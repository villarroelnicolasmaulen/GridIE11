# GridIE11
An example on how simulate a css grid in IE 11
## how works?
We need to define every position of the "grid-elements" for the final grid because IE11 does not recognize them automatically like the standard "grid-auto-rows"
## Why?
I'm Actually working developing a web app that needs to work in IE 11, and i not found a lot of information on how css-grid works on IE 11, i hope this can solve your problem!
